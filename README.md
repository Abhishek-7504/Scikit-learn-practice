This is my practice of the Scikit Learn library in ML from the udemy course. 
My key learnings include : 
  End-to-end sklearn workflow,
  Getting data ready,
  Choosing the right algorithm,
  Fitting the model,
  Evaluating the model,
  Improving the model,
  Save and load a trained model,
  Putting it all together
